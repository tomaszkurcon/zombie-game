## Description

When the game starts, zombies begin to appear. The player starts with an initial score of 30 points and 5 lives.  Failing to hit a zombie results in a loss of 3 points, while killing one adds 10 points. The more points you have, the more frequently zombies appear and they move at a higher speed. If a zombie is not killed in time, a life is lost. The game ends when the points drop to 0 or all lives are lost, at which point the playerâ€™s score is displayed along with an option to play again.
